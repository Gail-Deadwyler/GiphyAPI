# GiphyAPI
This application uses the Giphy API to generate Super Hero giphys. The user is presented with existing Super hero named buttons and the user can create their own Super hero named buttons. All buttons are dynamically generated. When the user clicks a button, the specific Super hero giphy is displayed on the screen along with the Rating. The gifs are non-animated. However, the user can stop and start animation by clicking the image.
